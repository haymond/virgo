# Mission

* Answer the question, "What multicurrency monetary system should we be designing for?"

Such a system should be transparent, secure, scalable, balance the needs of
privacy vs anti-money laundering, and designed to be provably stable with
minimal risk of systemic failure, and designed to incentivize the investment
into the local ecosystems and common infrastructures.
